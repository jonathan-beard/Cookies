\section{Sorghum Cookies}
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{description}
\item[1 cup] granulated sugar
\item[1 cup] margarine (watch the trans-fats)
\item[6 shots] espresso (okay to use Bialetti moka maker)
\item[2 tsp] baking soda
\item[1 tbs] ground ginger (fresh or from a bottle)
\item[$\ge$ 3 cups] bleached all purpose flour
\item[1 cup] sorghum
\end{description}
\subsection{Instructions}
Get a large bowl, the largest you have.  Add 1 cup granulated sugar,
ground ginger.  Microwave 1 cup margarine till liquid, mix with 
ingredients in bowl.  Measure out 1 cup of sorghum, microwave it
till liquid ($~1:30s$ on high with a $1000W$ microwave, preferably with
a Pyrex measuring cup).  Mix sorghum with other ingredients in bowl. 
Add espresso to mixture, again...stirring well.  With flour handy, 
mix in baking soda, stir in very well.  Bubbles will start to form
and your mixture will begin to grow.  Start adding flour, add two 
cups to start off and continue till you can knead the last big of
flour in and roll the ingredients on a large clean (also flour covered
to prevent sticking) counter (either
clean first or use wax paper).  Before beginning the rolling process,
preheat oven to $350F$ or $~175C$.  Roll dough out, cut some cookies
and place on a greased cookie sheet (or with parchment paper).  
Cook from 7-10 minutes or until 
brown on edges (slightly darker than the rest of the cookie).  You'll 
end up with quite a few cookies ($~36$).
